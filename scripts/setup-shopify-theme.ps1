<#
setup-shopify-theme.ps1

PowerShell helper to create a local Dawn theme and start the Shopify dev server.
This script only runs locally â€” I cannot execute it on your machine.

Usage (PowerShell):
  # replace store domain and optionally project path
  .\setup-shopify-theme.ps1 -Store "your-name-ai-store.myshopify.com" -ProjectPath "C:\Users\lizal\shopify_theme_tutorial"

Notes:
- Requires Git and Shopify CLI installed and available in PATH.
- `shopify login` will open a browser for auth. Run it interactively when prompted.
- This script will not push anything to remote; it only bootstraps the theme locally and starts `shopify theme dev`.
